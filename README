Build Flatpak single-file bundles for some certain packages not on Flathub, with GitHub Actions & GitHub Releases.

List:

- com.todesk.ToDesk from <https://github.com/chenyuanrun/flathub/tree/com.todesk.ToDesk> (Modified from <https://github.com/flathub/flathub/pull/5109>)
- io.github.vito0912.abs_flutter (from upstream pre-built release)
- dev.filimonov.klogg (from upstream appimage)

"COPYING" files within dirs are the license of each manifest files (xxx.yaml*), not for original software.

Notes:

- Update latest version:

   ```shell
   flatpak run org.flathub.flatpak-external-data-checker --edit-only xxx.yaml
   ```
